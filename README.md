# Open Health Risk Engine

Open Health Risk Engine is an end-to-end data science portfolio project that uses public NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic survey data to estimate depression risk from lifestyle and demographic variables. It includes a reproducible data pipeline, model comparison, SHAP-based explainability, automated tests, and a Streamlit interface for interactive scoring.

## Live Demo

- Primary live app (Render): https://open-health-risk-engine.onrender.com
- Direct Hugging Face app: https://andyombogo-open-health-risk-engine.hf.space
- Hugging Face project page: https://huggingface.co/spaces/andyombogo/open-health-risk-engine

Use the Render or `hf.space` links when you want the app itself. The `huggingface.co/spaces/...` link is the project page around the app, not just the calculator.

## What This Project Does

- Downloads public NHANES survey files from the CDC
- Cleans and merges lifestyle, sleep, BMI, alcohol, and demographic variables
- Engineers interpretable features for mental health risk modeling
- Trains Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers
- Selects a best model for deployment and surfaces feature importance and SHAP explanations
- Serves the final model through a Streamlit app designed for portfolio demos

## Model Snapshot

The current trained demo model uses **NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data** and selects **Random Forest** as the deployment model for its balance of performance and interpretability.

| Model | Test AUC-ROC | Test F1 | Precision | Recall |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Logistic Regression | 0.7811 | 0.3242 | 0.2110 | 0.6993 |
| Random Forest | 0.7591 | 0.3295 | 0.2331 | 0.5621 |
| XGBoost | 0.7438 | 0.2518 | 0.2800 | 0.2288 |

## Local Setup

```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv
py -3 -m pip --python .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run The Full Pipeline

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe src\download_data.py
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe src\data_cleaning.py
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe src\feature_engineering.py
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe src\train_model.py
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe explainability\shap_analysis.py
```

## Run Tests

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests -q
```

## Launch The App

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run app.py
```

## Deployment Notes

- GitHub repository URL: https://github.com/andyombogo/open-health-risk-engine
- Render live app URL: https://open-health-risk-engine.onrender.com
- Hugging Face Space URL: https://huggingface.co/spaces/andyombogo/open-health-risk-engine
- Hugging Face direct app URL: https://andyombogo-open-health-risk-engine.hf.space
- The app is packaged for Hugging Face Spaces using the `docker` SDK because Hugging Face deprecated Streamlit as the default built-in SDK in 2025.
- Recommended production-like host for fast links: Render using `render.yaml` on a non-sleeping `starter` plan.
